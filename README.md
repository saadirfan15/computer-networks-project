## 📌 Project Title
Smart Office Network using Cisco Packet Tracer

---

## 🎯 Project Objective
Design and simulate a computer network using Cisco Packet Tracer that demonstrates
basic networking concepts taught in lab sessions.

---

## ✅ Required Topics (Must Have)
- Star Topology  
- Router Configuration  
- DHCP Server Configuration  
- VLAN Implementation  
- Inter-VLAN Routing  
- IP Addressing Scheme  
- Network Simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer
